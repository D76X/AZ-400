Suggested Answer: D. Jira

Jira Software is a development tool used by agile teams to plan, track, and 
manage software releases. 

Using Azure Pipelines, teams can configure CI/CD pipelines for applications
of any language, deploying to any platform or any cloud.

Note: 
Microsoft and Atlassian have partnered together to build an integration 
between Azure Pipelines and Jira Software.
This integration connects the two products, providing full tracking of how 
and when the value envisioned with an issue is delivered to end users. 
This enables teams to setup a tight development cycle from issue creation through
release. 
Key development milestones like builds and deployments associated to a Jira issue
can then be tracked from within Jira Software.

Incorrect Answers:
C: 
Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. 
In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and
where something is in a process.

PT02-Q26:

You integrate a cloud-hosted Jenkins server and a new Azure DevOps deployment.

You need Azure DevOps to send a notification to Jenkins when a developer 
commits changes to a branch in Azure Repos.

Solution-1: You create a service hook subscription that uses the build 
completed event.

Solution 2: You create a service hook subscription that uses the code 
pushed event.

Does this meet the goal?


A26-1: A. Yes
A26-2: B. No


MY ANSWER TO PT02-Q26
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soulution-1 : A26-2: B. No

Obviously the build completed event would not be the correct event for the
service hook even if the service hook was a viable mechanism to notify 
a Jenking instance.
It is required to to send a notification to Jenkins when a developer 
commits changes therefore the event would be related to the Repo and not 
the build.

Solution-2: A26-1: A. Yes
You create a service hook subscription that uses the code pushed event.

Suggested Answer: D. a single-running branch with multiple short-lived topic branches

Topic branches, however, are useful in projects of any size. 
A topic branch is a short-lived branch that you create and use for a single
particular feature or related work. This is something you've likely never 
done with a VCS before because it's generally too expensive to create and 
merge branches. 
But in Git it's common to create, work on, merge, and delete branches 
several times a day.

Retrospectives: Be Agile and Thrive
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/devops-lab/retrospectives-be-agile-and-thrive 

Manage alerts, blameless retrospectives and a just culture
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/manage-alerts-blameless-retrospectives-just-culture/
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/manage-alerts-blameless-retrospectives-just-culture/8-examine-blameless-retrospective

Having a "blameless" retrospective process means that engineers whose actions have 
contributed to an accident can give a detailed account of:

What actions do they take at what time.
What effects do they observe?
Expectations they had.
Assumptions they had made.
Their understanding of the timeline of events as they occurred.

This cycle of name/blame/shame can be looked at like this:

Engineer acts and contributes to a failure or incident.
Engineer is punished, shamed, blamed, or retrained.
Reduced trust between engineers on the ground (the "sharp-end") and management (the "blunt end") looking for someone to scapegoat.
Engineers become silent on details about actions/situations/observations, resulting in "Cover-Your-Mistake" engineering (from fear of punishment)
Management becomes less aware and informed on how work is being performed daily. Engineers become less educated on lurking or latent conditions for failure because of the silence mentioned in the previous four.
Errors are more likely, and latent conditions can't be identified because of the previous five.
Repeat the first step.

Suggested Answer: A. Kanban boards

Customizing Kanban boards.
To maximize a team's ability to consistently deliver high quality software, 
Kanban emphasize two main practices. 

- The first, visualize the flow of work, requires you to map your team's 
workflow stages and configure your Kanban board to match. Your Kanban board
turns your backlog into an interactive signboard, providing a visual flow of
work.

- The second, constrain the amount of work in progress, requires you to set 
work-in-progress (WIP) limits.

PT02-Q22:

Your company has 60 developers who are assigned to four teams. 
Each team has 15 members. 

The company uses an agile development methodology. 
You need to structure the work of the development teams so that each team
owns its respective work while working together to reach a common goal. 

Which parts of the taxonomy should you enable the team to perform autonomously?

A22-1: A. Features and Tasks
A22-2: B. Initiatives and Epics
A22-3: C. Epics and Features
A22-4: D. Stories and Tasks
A22-4: 

MY ANSWER TO PT02-Q22
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the question referes to the agile development methodology on the types 
of assets realted to teh Agile Process may be referred to:
Bug | Epic | Feature | Issue | User Story | Task | Test case

Therefore the following is not applicable.
A22-2: B. Initiatives and Epics

Within Agile the common goal is represented by the Epics.
Therefore the individual teasm cannot own the Epics as these must be shared
by all teams.

Therefore the following is not applicable.
A22-3: C. Epics and Features

We are then left with the following options:

A22-1: A. Features and Tasks
A22-4: D. Stories and Tasks

Should the teams share Features or Stories?
I think each team should become responsible of rtheir own feature.

A feature is made up of possible several user stories that partecipate
together to create a functional piece of functionality. If we dividedthe work
among different teams at User Story level then it may happen that two or more 
teams would be coupled at feature level.
This is the opposite of what 

Therefore my answer is:
A22-1: A. Features and Tasks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

CORRECT ANSWER TO PT02-Q22
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A22-4: D. Stories and Tasks << but I am not sure this is right!

begin watching that repository. 
Anytime you join a new team, you will automatically be subscribed to updates
and receive notifications when that team is @mentioned. 

If you don't want to automatically be subscribed, 
you can unselect the automatic watching options.

QUESTION POSTS
https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/10248-exam-az-400-topic-5-question-20-discussion/

Suggested Answer: B. Create a new feed for the package

Azure Artifacts introduces the concept of multiple feeds that you can use to
organize and control access to your packages.
Packages you host in Azure Artifacts are stored in a feed. 
Setting permissions on the feed allows you to share your packages with as many or
as few people as your scenario requires.

Feeds have four levels of access: Owners, Contributors, Collaborators, and Readers.

PT02-Q16:

Your company uses GitHub for source control. 
The company has a team that performs code reviews.
You need to automate the assignment of the code reviews. 

The solution must meet the following requirements:

-Prioritize the assignment of code reviews to team members who have the
 fewest outstanding assignments.
-Ensure that each team member performs an equal number of code reviews
 in any 30-day period.
-Prevent the assignment of code reviews to the team leader.

Which two actions should you perform? 

Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

A16-1: A. Clear Never assign certain team members.
A16-2: B. Select If assigning team members, don't notify the entire team.
A16-3: C. Select Never assign certain team members.
A16-4: D. Set Routing algorithm to Round robin.
A16-4: E. Set Routing algorithm to Load balance.


MY ANSWER TO PT02-Q16
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We definitely need to select the option:
C. Select Never assign certain team members.

and 
the option A. cannot be selected:
A16-1: A. Clear Never assign certain team members.

In order to: 
-Prevent the assignment of code reviews to the team leader.

Then the remaing options are:

A16-2: B. Select If assigning team members, don't notify the entire team.
A16-4: D. Set Routing algorithm to Round robin.
A16-4: E. Set Routing algorithm to Load balance.

The option:
A16-2: B. Select If assigning team members, don't notify the entire team.

does not appear among the requirements therefore is irrelevant.

Then the remaing options are:

A16-4: D. Set Routing algorithm to Round robin.
A16-4: E. Set Routing algorithm to Load balance.

The question is: which of these satisfies the remaining requirements?

-Prioritize the assignment of code reviews to team members who have the
 fewest outstanding assignments.
-Ensure that each team member performs an equal number of code reviews
 in any 30-day period.

 I believe it is:
 A16-4: E. Set Routing algorithm to Load balance.

Suggested Answer: AE
A16-1: A. Clear Never assign certain team members.
A16-4: E. Set Routing algorithm to Load balance.

A: A. Clear Never assign certain team members.

To always skip certain members of the team > 
select Never assign certain team members. 
Then, select one or more team members you'd like to always skip. 
In this case select the team leader.

E: E. Set Routing algorithm to Load balance.

The load balance algorithm chooses reviewers based on each member's total number 
of recent review requests and considers the number of outstanding reviews for 
each member. 
The load balance algorithm tries to ensure that each team member reviews an equal
number of pull requests in any 30 day period.

------------------
Incorrect Answers:
------------------
D: 
The round robin algorithm chooses reviewers based on who's received the least 
recent review request, focusing on alternating between all members of the team 
** regardless of the number of outstanding reviews they currently have. **

BFG Repo-Cleaner
https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/
BFG Repo-Cleaner an alternative to git-filter-branch

The BFG is a simpler, faster alternative to git-filter-branch for cleansing 
bad data out of your Git repository history:
 - Removing Crazy Big Files
 - Removing Passwords, Credentials & other Private data

The git-filter-branch command is enormously powerful and can do things that 
the BFG can't - but the BFG is much better for the tasks above, because:

Faster : 10 - 720x faster
Simpler : The BFG isn't particularily clever, but is focused on making the 
above tasks easy

Beautiful : If you need to, you can use the beautiful Scala language to 
customise the BFG. Which has got to be better than Bash scripting at least
some of the time.

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch

WARNING
git filter-branch has a plethora of pitfalls that can produce non-obvious 
manglings of the intended history rewrite (and can leave you with little 
time to investigate such problems since it has such abysmal performance). 
These safety and performance issues cannot be backward compatibly fixed 
and as such, its use is not recommended. Please use an alternative history
filtering tool such as git filter-repo. 
If you still need to use git filter-branch, please carefully read 
SAFETY (and PERFORMANCE) to learn about the land mines of filter-branch
and then vigilantly avoid as many of the hazards listed there as reasonably
possible.

You need 
- to make a custom package available to all the developers. 
- The package must be managed centrally, and 
- the latest version must be available for consumption in Visual Studio automatically. 

Which three actions should you perform?

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

A14-1: A. Publish the package to a feed.
A14-2: B. Create a new feed in Azure Artifacts.
A14-3: C. Upload a package to a Git repository   < wrong!

A14-5: E. Add the package URL to the NuGet Package Manager settings in Visual Studio.
A14-6: F. Create a Git repository in Azure Repos. < wrong!

MY ANSWER TO PT02-Q14
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some options are obviously wrong:
A14-3: C. Upload a package to a Git repository
A14-6: F. Create a Git repository in Azure Repos.

This leaves us with 4 remaining options of which we must select 3.

A14-1: A. Publish the package to a feed.
A14-2: B. Create a new feed in Azure Artifacts.
A14-4: D. Add the package URL to the Environment settings in Visual Studio.
A14-5: E. Add the package URL to the NuGet Package Manager settings in Visual Studio.

The right logical order would be the following.
A14-2: B. Create a new feed in Azure Artifacts.
A14-1: A. Publish the package to a feed.

obviously onle one of the following can be correct:
A14-4: D. Add the package URL to the Environment settings in Visual Studio.
A14-5: E. Add the package URL to the NuGet Package Manager settings in Visual Studio.

I think that the correct options between these two is:
A14-5: E. Add the package URL to the NuGet Package Manager settings in Visual Studio.

Finally the 3 options in their logic order are the following:

A14-2: B. Create a new feed in Azure Artifacts.
A14-5: E. Add the package URL to the NuGet Package Manager settings in Visual Studio.
A14-1: A. Publish the package to a feed.

Note: 
Technical debt is the accumulation of sub-optimal technical decisions made
over the lifetime of an application. Eventually, it gets harder to change 
things: it's the 'sand in the gears' that sees IT initiatives grind to a halt.


Reference:

5 Ways DevOps Helps With Technical Debt
https://www.devopsgroup.com/blog/five-ways-devops-helps-with-technical-debt/

It is worth pointing out that technical debt doesn’t only occur in development, 
** it can occur in operations too **.
For Example:

- Still running an out-of-date OS that’s no longer supported, like Windows Server 2008 or Ubuntu 11.04
- Not keeping your servers patched and up to date 
- leaving you vulnerable to cyber-attack and ransomware

--------------------------------
Is Technical Debt Always Bad?
--------------------------------

Refer ro the concept: TechnicalDebtQuadrant - Martin Fowler
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html

------------------------------------
Prudent, deliberate technical debt 
------------------------------------
is at the heart of Eric Ries’ ‘Build-Measure-Learn’ cycle from The Lean Startup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkaabHiZN-k

------------------------------------------------------------
So, how can DevOps address the technical debt challenge?
------------------------------------------------------------

One of the key tenets of DevOps is creating small, multidisciplinary teams (i.e. Dev + Ops) 
who own the entire lifecycle of a product or service from ‘inception to retirement’. 
Because these teams (including their product managers) feel the impact of technical debt
every day, they are highly motivated to pay it back to make life easier.

****************************************************** 
Simple things can help teams tackle technical debt.
****************************************************** 

--------------------------------------------------
1. Create DevOps Product Teams 
--------------------------------------------------
You can do this by 

- labelling work items
-carve out part of every sprint to work on technical debt items 
( We’d suggest at least 20% of a sprint commitment)
- every team retro, do a quick thumbs up/down (or planning poker) on current levels of technical debt.
- try to avoid creating more technical debt in new product development.
- If you need to create prudent, deliberate technical debt, track it and allocate effort to pay it back in the future.

DevOps patterns and practices, like using CI/CD code pipelines to build, test, package
and deploy applications, enables teams to move faster, with less risk and less technical 
debt.
Code pipelines also provide end-to-end traceability of application code
– from user story to code commit to released package.

This helps derive clear, customer-driven priorities for where to focus technical 
debt repayment efforts.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Build Shared Self-Service Platforms 
--------------------------------------------------

** 
Increasingly, organisations are building shared self-service platforms to support product teams.
In other words, where possible use PaaS+Best Practices
**

More in detail..

- platforms help avoid the technical debt of having to build and maintain toolchains.
- Teams can consume a self-service platform (i.e. an internal or third party software-as-a-service (SaaS) style solution) instead.
- Platform teams build these services to meet the needs of product teams, along with best-practice templates, reference architectures and other code building blocks that might be needed.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Use DevOps Automation to Repay Tech Debt
--------------------------------------------------
But how does DevOps automation help repay technical debt?

-------------------------------------
‘virtuous circle’ of automation
-------------------------------------

The time you spend NOT troubleshooting deployments due to snowflake environment issues 
is time you can invest paying back even more technical debt. 
This leads to a ‘virtuous circle’ of automation.

CALMS Culture-Automation-Lean-Measurement-Sharing

Inherent in any DevOps approach is the heavy use of automation. 
he services platforms provide are often automation toolchains for the product teams to use.

------------------------------------------------------
The Problem of Inconsistency: minimize it  
------------------------------------------------------
- infrastructure-as-code 
- configuration-as-code 
can help repay technical debt while avoiding future debt.


Inconsistent aka ‘snowflake’ environments are a prevalent form of technical debt
that almost everyone will have experienced. When your application works in Dev but
not in Pre-Production or, even worse, not in Production, the root cause is often 
inconsistency. 

- operating system configuration
- application dependencies
- the myriad configuration settings upon which the application depends 
- the communication between different services that comprise the application

 The time you spend troubleshooting issues like these is the cost, the impact, of your technical debt.

- infrastructure-as-code 
- configuration-as-code 
enable you to precisely express your intent for how you want the environment to be.
Then, via the power of tools like Terraform and Puppet, you can (declaratively) ‘make it so’, 
** consistently ** in every instance of that environment. 

************************************
** Containerisation ** 
takes this to the next level.
************************************

-------------------------
As-code automation
-------------------------
‘As-code’ automation also has another benefit. 
Holding DevOps automation as code, in a repository like GitHub, rather than describing 
config settings in verbose Word documents or Visio diagrams, makes it simpler and easier
to iterate and improve. People can discover the code easily via search, submit suggested
changes via pull requests, or even fork code, modifying and extending it to meet their 
needs. 
This ability to iterate means automation code is less likely to get ‘out of date’ thereby
avoiding another form of technical debt.

-----------------------------------------------------------
4. Use Containers to Simplify App Deployment and Management
-----------------------------------------------------------
************************************
** Containerisation ** 
takes this to the next level.
************************************

containers enable you to hold 
 
 - your application 
 - its configuration 
 - OS dependencies 
 
in one lightweight bundle that’s easier to deploy and faster to provision.
As with the environment management automation example discussed earlier, 
the portability of containers simplifies everything.

Container orchestration tools like Kubernetes go even further, enabling 
automation of the container lifecycle in production, freeing DevOps teams
to focus on higher-value tasks (like re-architecting applications to reduce
technical debt).

Organisations building new, cloud-native applications typically use containers 
to improve 
 - flexibility
 - scalability 
 - total cost of ownership (TCO)

--------------------------------------------
The ‘microservices’ architectural pattern 
--------------------------------------------
 - works well with containers 
 and
 - more importantly, the small multidisciplinary DevOps product teams

Each microservice is 

 - small 
 - with a clear bounded context
 - managed by a long-lived team. 

** So, technical debt is easier to spot and fix **

-----------------------------------------------
5. Using DevOps to Build an API-Centric Model
** 
with APIs AND  ideally supporting ‘semantic versioning’ 
we can
1. REDUCE CODE COMPEXITY
2. REDUCE COUPLING BETWEEN PRODUCTS / FEATURS / PRODUCERS / CONSUMERS
-----------------------------------------------

The microservices model discussed above is one way to implement an 
API-centric application strategy.
Jeff Bezos famously challenged his teams to ONLY use APIs to communicate
between their systems “or be fired”.
Encouraging teams to build and consume APIs with well-defined, versioned 
interfaces is a great way to reduce technical debt.
Often, technical debt is caused by different systems accessing services 
and data in ways that other teams don’t expect. 

***************************************************************
APIs make these interfaces more visible and less fragile. 
less fragility = less technical debt
***************************************************************

https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/78922-exam-az-400-topic-4-question-56-discussion/

Suggested Answer: A. Store the secrets in the environment variables instead of the pipeline variables.

Don't set secret variables in your YAML file. 
Operating systems often log commands for the processes that they run, and you
wouldn't want the log to include a secret that you passed in as an input. 

Use the **script's environment** 
or 
**
map the variable within the variables block to pass secrets to your pipeline.
**

The following example shows how to use a secret variable called mySecret in PowerShell 
and Bash scripts. Unlike a normal pipeline variable, there's no environment variable
called MYSECRET.

```
variables:
 GLOBAL_MYSECRET: $(mySecret) # this will not work because the secret variable needs to be mapped as env
 GLOBAL_MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(nonSecretVariable) # this works because it's not a secret.

steps:

- powershell: |
    Write-Host "Using an input-macro works: $(mySecret)"
    Write-Host "Using the env var directly does not work: $env:MYSECRET"
    Write-Host "Using a global secret var mapped in the pipeline does not work either: $env:GLOBAL_MYSECRET"
    Write-Host "Using a global non-secret var mapped in the pipeline works: $env:GLOBAL_MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR" 
    Write-Host "Using the mapped env var for this task works and is recommended: $env:MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR"
  env:
    MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(mySecret) # the recommended way to map to an env variable

- bash: |
    echo "Using an input-macro works: $(mySecret)"
    echo "Using the env var directly does not work: $MYSECRET"
    echo "Using a global secret var mapped in the pipeline does not work either: $GLOBAL_MYSECRET"
    echo "Using a global non-secret var mapped in the pipeline works: $GLOBAL_MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR" 
    echo "Using the mapped env var for this task works and is recommended: $MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR"
  env:
    MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(mySecret) # the recommended way to map to an env variable

```
-----------------------
Incorrect Answers:
-----------------------
B: Never pass secrets on the command line.

C: Adding a prefix does not make the variable a secret. 
The ** issecret property ** makes it secret but does not prevent logging of the secret.

D: Never echo secrets as output.

Suggested Answer: B. Git

Git history: File history is replicated on the client dev machine and can 
be viewed even when not connected to the server. You can view history in 
Visual Studio and on the web portal.
Note: 
Azure Repos supports two types of version control: 
- Git 
- Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC).

Incorrect Answers:
A: Team Foundation Version Control: 
File history is not replicated on the client dev machine and so can be viewed
only when you're connected to the server.

Suggested Answer: C. Black Duck

Secure and Manage Open Source Software
Black Duck helps organizations identify and mitigate open source security, 
license compliance and code-quality risks across application and container 
portfolios.
Black Duck Hub and its plugin for Team Foundation Server (TFS) allows you 
to automatically find and fix open source security vulnerabilities during 
the build process, so you can proactively manage risk. The integration allows
you to receive alerts and fail builds when any Black Duck Hub policy violations
are met.

Note: ** WhiteSource ** would also be a good answer, but it is not an option here.
