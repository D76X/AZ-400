You have been hired as a consultant to create this repository and to Implement
their code flow on the team structure and company policies.

Development Team:

- 2 QA analysts who are responsible for dealing with quality requirements and maintaining the automatic test cases.
- 1 infrastructure analyst who is responsible for deploying new application versions. 

Each role has a  corresponding Azure DevOps Group to manage permission.
All of the permissions are attached to the group and not to individual users.

-------------------
Requirements:
-------------------

R1:
Every code change in the main branch must be auditable and these will require 
a user story association and a review from a teach leader

R2:
Developers must include new code by using a pull request without breaking the test cases.

R3:
The developr's machine must access the code repository from command line tools
without using passwords.

R4:
Test cases must be executed on every pull request.

R5:
The commit history should be linear, should maintain every developer commit and
should not contain merge commits on the main branch.

R6:
To merge a PR on the main branch, all test must pass.
If the tests are failing QA and Tech Lead can bypass the checks and complete 
the merge as-is.

R7:
The infrastucture analyst should be able to publish tags for commits in the 
main branch using a command line script.

R8:

------------
Question 1
------------
You need to create the main branch according to the company policies.
A pipeline needs to be configured along with the main branch.

Which 4 actions should you perform in sequence?

All the available actions:

-Create a fork                                  (NA)
-Create a repository                             01     
-Create a build pipeline
-Enable the continuos integration trigger.
-Create a main branch.                           02
-Clone the repository.                          (NA)
-Add branch permission

MY ANSWER:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a new project therefore there is no existing codebase.
This rules out the following:
-Create a fork
-Clone the repository.

The you must create the repo and the main branch with it.
-Create a repository 
-Create a main branch.
