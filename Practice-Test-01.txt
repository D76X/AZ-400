Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) resources, like 
 - Azure SQL 
 - Web Sites (Web Apps), 

can emit performance metrics data natively to ** Log Analytics. **

The Premium plan will retain up to 12 months of data, 
giving you an excellent baseline ability.

There are two options available in the Azure portal for analyzing data 
stored in Log analytics and for creating queries for ad hoc analysis.

Incorrect Answers:
B: ** Intelligent Insights** analyzes database performance by comparing the
database workload from the last hour with the past seven-day baseline workload. 
However, we need handle application metrics as well!

REFS

Configure liveness probes
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-liveness-probe?source=recommendations

Containerized applications may run for extended periods of time, resulting 
in broken states that may need to be repaired by restarting the container. 
Azure Container Instances supports liveness probes so that you can configure
your containers within your container group to restart if critical functionality
is not working.

Configure readiness probes
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-readiness-probe

For containerized applications that serve traffic, you might want to verify
that your container is ready to handle incoming requests. 
Azure Container Instances supports readiness probes to include 
configurations so that your container can't be accessed under certain 
conditions. 
For example, a container application might need to load a large data set 
during startup, and you don't want it to receive requests during this time.

REFS: PT01-Q25

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-webhooks

Correct answer is C.

-------------------
HTTPWebhook trigger < inbound subscription
-------------------
This trigger makes your logic app callable by creating an endpoint that can 
register a subscription by calling the specified endpoint URL. When you create
this trigger in your workflow, an outgoing request makes the call to register
the subscription.

-------------------
HTTP trigger        > outbound (scheduled)
-------------------
This trigger sends a request to the specified HTTP or HTTPS endpoint based on
the specified recurrence schedule. The trigger then checks the response to 
determine whether the workflow runs.

-------------------
Request trigger		< inbound
-------------------
This trigger makes your logic app callable by creating an endpoint that can
accept incoming requests.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/service-hooks/services/teams?view=azure-devops
See activity about your Azure DevOps Server (2017.2 and later) 
projects directly in your Microsoft Teams channel, 
for example:
 - Work item updates
 - Pull requests
 - Code commits
 - Builds
 - Release deployments and approvals

it is a two-step process

STEP-1
set up a connector in Teams

STEP-2
set up one or more **service hook subscriptions** in 
your Azure DevOps Server project.

- Project administrator permissions are required to 
  create service hook subscriptions.
- Events for YAML pipelines are not supported

This 2-step process to bring events 
from Azure DevOps 
into Microsoft Teams 
can be accomplished as follows
- From Teams
- From Azure DevOps Server

-----------
From Teams
-----------
>> select '...', the ellipsis, or at the upper navigation 
of your team channel
>> select Connectors.
>> Select Azure DevOps from the list.
>> Add
>> Configure the connector.
>> Copy the generated webhook URL. 
  Provide this URL when you're setting up service hook subscriptions 
  in your Azure DevOps project.
  This URL is where your Microsoft Teams Service listens for 
  notifications sent by the Azure DevOps Connector

---------------------------
From Azure DevOps Server

Suggested Answer: C. Add the Azure Boards app to the repository.

To connect Azure Boards to GitHub.com
 
 1- connect and configure from Azure Boards
 
 alternatively 
 
 2- install and configure the Azure Boards app from within GitHub

Both methods support authenticating and operating via the app 
rather than an individual!

Suggested Answer: D. Smart Detection


REFS

Smart detection in Application Insights
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/proactive-diagnostics

Smart detection automatically warns you of about the following in your web application

 - potential performance problems 
 - failure anomalies 
 - sudden rise in failure rates or abnormal patterns 
   in client or server performance 
 - you get an alert
 - access the detections issued by smart detection from 
   - emails you receive 
   - from the smart detection pane

What problems are detected?
 
  -1 Failure Anomalies
     Notifies if the failure rate goes outside the expected envelope. 
	 With machine learning set the expected rate of failed requests
	 for your app, correlating with load and other factors.
  
  -2 Performance Anomalies
     if response time of an operation or dependency duration is slowing 
	 down compared to the historical baseline. 
	 identify an anomalous pattern in response time or page load time.

  -3 General Degradation Issues
     - Trace degradation
	 - Memory leak
	 - Abnormal rise in Exception volume
	 - Security anti-patterns.

https://www.udemy.com/course/azure100/learn/lecture/33596546#overview
 - ARM Template that apply a Custom Script Extension to each VM of the VMSS
   for this use the [extensionProfile].[extensions] section of the ARM template
   In this example two different extensions are applied

   Extension-1

 - Install IIS
 - Install the ASP.Net Core Hosting Bunlde on each VS SS IIS instance
 - You may use the same technique to install a WebApp on each IIS instance
 - The WebApp binaries may be stored on a storage account

Suggested Procedures

-------------------
Suggestion-1
-------------------

It seems it can be done in 2 ways:

Option1 :
 - C. Upload a custom script file to sa1.
   With this you Upload new script with newer version of code to be deployed
   to the VMs to the SA.

 - D. Modify the Custom Script extension settings of VMSS1.
   With this you point the Scaleset to the new script in the storage account.
   For example, in the case of a deplyment with a ARM template you may do so
   by means of a modification to the "fileUris" element of the ARM tamplate.

 - E. Update the configuration of a virtual machine in VMSS1.
   For example..
   Increase the number of VMS in scaleset from say 3 to 4. 
   With this change , the new VM that is VM-4 will be started and the new 
   version of the code downloaded on it. 
   The first 3 VMS will continue to run with older version of code.

-------------------
Suggestion-2
-------------------

The answer is CDE. 

A and B are simply not related. 
A31-1: A. Modify the load balancer settings of VMSS1.
A31-2: B. Redeploy VMSS1.

We do not need to make any changes to the LOAD BALANCER FOR THE scaleset
to deploy a small UI change.

Canary deployment 

- It is a pattern that rolls out releases to a subset of users or servers. 
- It deploys the changes to a small set of servers.
- It allows you to test and monitor how the new release works before 
  rolling the changes to the rest of the servers.

- VMSS allow you to manage large number of identical VMs with simple instructions
- ** yet allow you to update specific VMs. **

VMSS BUILD 

- you can build your VMSS with a 
- customized image 
- publicly available OS images 
+ VM extension scripts to setup all required environments.

VMSS UPDATE

- update its configuration with a new image 
- or extension scripts
- Then manually trigger the update of the VMSS instances
  either ** all ** in one instruction 
  or 
  **selectively pick some VMs to be updated.**

CANARY ON VMSS

- The ability to update ** individual VMs in VMSS ** allows us
  to control the number of VMs that will be updated to the new releases

 - STEP-1

Suggested Answer: A. Azure Application Insights

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/
Application Insights will  
 - tell you about any performance issues and exceptions
 - help you find and diagnose the root causes.
 - can monitor both Java and ASP.NET web applications and services, WCF services. 
 - take telemetry from web pages and a wide variety of devices including iOS, Android, and Windows Store apps.

Manage applications by using Azure Monitor Application Insights
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/design-monitoring-strategy-on-azure/4-application-insights

-------------------------------------
You can use Application Insights to:
-------------------------------------

 - Analyze and address issues and problems that affect your application's health and performance.
 - Improve your application's development lifecycle.
 - Measure your user experience and analyze users' behavior.

- Instrumentation refers to enabling the collection of monitoring data from your app
  by using an agent or an SDK
- In many cases, you can perform instrumentation without access to the source code 
  using codeless attach in the Azure portal or by using an agent.
- Application Insights also automatically detect app dependencies to support 
  distributed tracing and create application topology views.
- view the slowest requests for an instance and investigate performance

-----------------------
Analyzing user behavior
-----------------------

 - Instrumenting your web pages with Application Insights collects usage 
   information to augment the server-side monitoring capabilities. 
 
 from the browser-side JavaScript instrumentation data includes
 - umber of users
 - sessions
 - events
 - browser version
 - OS version
 - locations 

 answers questions such as 
 - which pages of your app are the most popular
 - where users drop out
 - the conversion and retention rates for specific pages.

 You can use this type of information to ** inform decisions ** 
 - for allocating functional and performance-testing resources.

 ----------------------------------------
 Monitor your application’s availability
 ----------------------------------------

 You can create availability tests to monitor the health of your applications continuously. 
 Availability tests allow you to check the health of your application from different geographic locations.
 You can create an availability test in the Azure portal. 
 You'll specify details like the frequency, the URL of your application, and locations from which to test it.

 ----------------------------------------
 Receive notifications and take action
 ----------------------------------------
 configure alert rules for your application’s performance and availability. 
 Use alert rules to dictate how alerts should be handled.
 You can specify the conditions that should trigger an alert. 
 For example Application Insights can 
  - send an alert if a specified number of locations are unavailable
  - if a certain number of exceptions are observed
  - etc.
 
 You can also specify who should be notified
 Application Insights can send notifications 
  - email | text message 
  
 Application Insights can respond to alerts in an automated way.
  - use runbooks 
  - webhooks

Suggested Answer: B. Create an Azure Application Insights availability test and alert.

There are three types of Application Insights availability tests: 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -1 URL ping test: a simple test that you can create in the Azure portal. <<
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/monitor-web-app-availability#create-a-url-ping-test
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -2 Multi-step web test
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/availability-multistep
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -3 Custom Track Availability Tests

- Azure Application Insights sends web requests to your application at 
  regular intervals from points around the world. 
- It can alert you if your application isn't responding, or if it responds too slowly.
- You can set up availability tests for any HTTP or HTTPS endpoint that is accessible from the public internet. 
- You don't have to make any changes to the website you're testing. 
- it doesn't even have to be a site you own. 
- You can test the availability of a REST API that your service depends on.

REFS

----------------------------------------------------
B. Create an Azure Application Insights availability test and alert.

-1 URL ping test: a simple test that you can create in the Azure portal. <<
Monitor availability with URL ping tests
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/monitor-web-app-availability#create-a-url-ping-test

- The name URL ping test is a bit of a misnomer. 
- These tests don't use the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to check your site's availability.
- they use more advanced HTTP request functionality to validate whether an endpoint is responding.
- They measure the performance associated with that response.
- They also add the ability to set custom success criteria, 
  coupled with more advanced features like parsing dependent
  requests and allowing for retries.

To create an availability test, you need to use an 
- existing Application Insights resource 
- or create an Application Insights resource.

----------------
Test locations:	
----------------

The values for this setting are the places from which servers
send web requests to your URL. We recommend a minimum of 
5 test locations to ensure that you can distinguish problems 
in your website from network issues. 
You can select up to 16 locations.

------------------------------------------------------------
-2 Multi-step web test
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/availability-multistep

 Multistep web tests have been deprecated. 
 We recommend using TrackAvailability() to submit custom availability 
 tests instead of multistep web tests.

----------------------------------------------------
D. Create an Azure Service Health alert for the specific regions.

Configure Resource Health alerts in the Azure portal
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/resource-health-alert-monitor-guide
Azure Resource Health keeps you informed about the current and historical 
health status of your Azure resources. 
Azure Resource Health alerts can notify you in near real-time when these 
resources have a change in their health status.
Resource health notifications are stored in the Azure activity log .
You can receive an alert when Azure resource sends resource health notifications
to your Azure subscription.

 You can configure the alert based on:

- The subscription affected.
- The resource(s) type(s) affected.
- The resource group(s) affected.
- The resource(s) affected.
- The event status(s) of the resource(s) affected.
- The resource(s) affected statuses.
- The reason(s) type(s) of the resource(s) affected.

You also can configure who the alert should be sent to:

- Select an existing action group.
- Create a new action group (that can be used for future alerts). 

What is Azure Service Health?
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/overview
Azure Service Health is a combination of three separate smaller services.

-1 Azure status overview 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/azure-status-overview
provides you with a global view of the health of Azure services and regions. 

-2 Service Health portal classic experience overview
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/service-health-overview

Analyze infrastructure security by using Microsoft Defender for Cloud
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/design-monitoring-strategy-on-azure/6-security-center
Microsoft Defender for Cloud ensures that you make the security configuration
of your resources as secure as possible.

You use Defender for Cloud to:

 - Understand the security posture of your architecture.
 - Identify and address risks and threats to your infrastructure.
 - Secure a complex infrastructure with traditional in-house skills and capital.
 - Secure an infrastructure that consists of on-premises and cloud resources.
 
 Defender for Cloud gives you detailed analyses of different components of 
 your environment. 
 Defender for Cloud collects data from your machines to monitor for security
 vulnerabilities and threats using 
 ** Azure Monitor Logs. **
 Data is collected using the 
 ** Log Analytics agent **
 which reads various security-related configurations and event logs from the 
 machine and copies the data to your ** Log Analytics workspace** for analysis.
 -----------------------------
 - data security
 - network security
 - identity and access 
 - application security
 -----------------------------

 Defender for Cloud **recommends** ways to address the issues and risks that
 it's uncovered. 

 ----------------------------------------------------------
 Protect against threats with Microsoft Defender for Cloud
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 use access and application controls in Defender for Cloud to help protect your resources. 
 These controls block suspicious activity.
  
  ---
  JIT
  ---
  - virtual machines through just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine access.
  - You enable can JIT through the Just in time VM access option in the 
    Microsoft Defender for Cloud >>  Advanced protection section 
  - Defender for Cloud shows you a list of default ports that JIT will target.
  - You can also configure your own

  -------------------------------
  Adaptive application controls
  -------------------------------
  You can control which applications are allowed to run on your virtual machines.
  Create application control rules to target the virtual machines.

  ----------------------------------------------------
  Respond to threats with Microsoft Defender for Cloud
  ----------------------------------------------------
  Defender for Cloud 
   - gives you a centralized view of all of your security alerts. 
   - ranks security alerts based on their severity.
   - combines related alerts as much as possible into a single security incident
   - You have the responsibility to dismiss alerts if no action is required
   - you must decide which alerts require more investigation.
   - You also need to act to address known attacks and block, for example, known malicious IP addresses. 
   - Defender for Cloud helps you respond to threats faster, and in an automated way by taking action. 
     - triggering an automated response with Logic Apps,
	 - suppressing similar alerts.
	 - Playbooks are automated procedures that you can run against alerts


Analyze enterprise security by using Microsoft Sentinel
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/design-monitoring-strategy-on-azure/7-sentinel

--------------------------------------
Why would you use Microsoft Sentinel? 
--------------------------------------
You want a detailed overview of your enterprise, potentially 
across multiple clouds, and on-premises locations.

You can use Microsoft Sentinel to:

 - Get a detailed overview of your organization, potentially across multiple clouds 
   and on-premises locations.
 - Avoid reliance on complex and disparate tools.
 - Use enterprise-grade AI, built by experts, to identify and handle threats 
   across your organization.

 You can create a Microsoft Sentinel resource in the Azure portal. 
 The process for creating this resource involves creating a 
 ** Log Analytics workspace** then adding it to Sentinel.
 
 ----------
 Connectors
 ----------
 Sentinel integrates with Microsoft solutions, including
 - Azure Active Directory 
 - Office 365
 - onnectors for non-Microsoft solutions
 - also has a REST API that allows you to connect to other data sources.
 
 -----------------------------------
 alerts to monitor your enterprise
 -----------------------------------
 - When your data sources have been connected, Sentinel begins to monitor your enterprise.
 - create alert rules and configure alert rules to investigate anomalies and threats 
   more intelligently.
 - respond manually or 
 - by using playbooks for automated responses

 ---------------------
 Investigate incidents
 ---------------------
 - Sentinel combines your generated alerts into incidents for further investigation.
 - You can select an incident to start to investigate it. 
 - you get an investigation map.
   You can use the map to better understand what caused an incident and the affected scope.
 - use the map to correlate data surrounding an incident.
 - If you hover over an entity, you'll also get a list of exploration queries 
   designed by Microsoft security analysts and experts. 
   You use exploration queries to investigate more effectively.
 - The investigation map also gives you a timeline that helps you understand 
   which event occurred at a particular time. 

 ----------------------------------
 Respond to threats with playbooks
 ----------------------------------
  - Playbooks can help you automatically respond to threats in Sentinel
  - You add a new playbook by creating a logic app.
  - When you've configured your playbook, you can point to it in your alert rules.

Azure Artifacts overview
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/start-using-azure-artifacts?view=azure-devops&tabs=nuget
Azure Artifacts enables developers to share their code efficiently 
and manage all their packages from one place. 
Developers can publish packages to 
 -their feeds and share it within the same team
 -across organizations
 -publicly > Only from a Azure DevOps Public Projetcs! 

Developers can also consume packages from different feeds and 
public registries
- Package Type: Nuget > NuGet.org 
- Package Type: npm (JavaScript) > npmjs.com. 
- Package Type: several types (Python) > there are several Python package registers
- Package Type: Maven (Java) > https://search.maven.org/

----------------------------------------------
- Members of your Azure AD Tenants
- Memmbers of your Azure DevOps Organizations
- Specific People

  -----------------------------------
  Visual Studio / VSCode / Nuget.exe
  -----------------------------------
> Get Instruction on how to setup the consumer to connect to the Feed
  Each consumer is set up differently.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the main purposes of Azure Artifacts is to make Private Package Feeds
available to a group of authenticated consumers to that they mayy consume
packages and/or upload and update packages on the Feed. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

AZ-400 Axure Artifacts - Other Aspects
https://www.udemy.com/course/azure100/learn/lecture/33592822#overview

All Artifacts feeds come with three Default views: 

@local 
@prerelease
@release

@local : it's the default Feed View
view contains all packages published directly to the feed and all packages 
saved from upstream sources.

Feed Views
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/concepts/views?view=azure-devops
Feed views enable developers to share a subset of package-versions with their consumers. 

A common use of feed views is 
- to share package versions that have been tested and validated 
but 
- hold back on packages that are still under development and/or didn't meet a certain
quality bar.

-------------------------------
Feed views are read-only
users connected to a view can only use packages that are published to that view 
and/or packages previously saved from upstream sources.

Feed View Visibility : depending on your scenario
you must set your feed's visibility to 

- members of your organization
or 
- members of your Azure Active Directory.

If you choose the latter, all people in your organization will be able to access 
your feed. 
In addition, 
all feeds in your organization and other organizations associated with the same
Azure Active Directory tenant will be able to upstream to your feed.

-------------------------------

Release packages with feed views

When creating release packages, it's important to convey three pieces of information: 

Example: Semantic Versioning

1.2.3-beta2
1.2.3-prerelease

------------------------------------------------------------------
1- the nature of the change		> major.minor.patch
2- the risk of the change		> major > minor > patch
3- the quality of the change	-beta2
------------------------------------------------------------------

The @release View

You can use the @Release view as a means to convey the quality of your 
changes. Using the @Release view, you can share packages that met your
quality bar and allow your consumers to only see the subset of package
versions that were tested, validated, and are ready to be consumed.

Use feed views to share packages
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/feeds/views?view=azure-devops

Azure Artifacts - Manage permissions
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/feeds/feed-permissions?view=azure-devops
By configuring permissions for your feed, you can manage access to your 
packages and control who can interact with them.

-----------------------------------------------
Access to the Feed and Access to the Feed View
-----------------------------------------------

Users who have access to a specific view are able to access and download 
packages from the feed through that view even if they don't have direct 
access to that feed. 

If you want to completely hide your packages, you must restrict access
to both feed and views.

Views inherit permissions from the parent feed. 
If you set a view's visibility to Specific people without specifying
any users or groups, the view's permissions will default back to the
permissions of its parent feed.

-----------------------------------------------
Access the Feed from a Build Pipeline
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/feeds/feed-permissions?view=azure-devops
-----------------------------------------------
To access your feed from your pipeline, the corresponding build identity
must have the necessary permissions.
By default, feeds have the Project Collection Build Service role set to
Collaborator.

The project-level build identity is named as follows: 
-------------------------------------------------------
[Project name] Build Service ([Organization name])
-------------------------------------------------------
Example: FabrikamFiber Build Service (codesharing-demo)
-------------------------------------------------------

If you want to access a feed in a different project from your pipeline, 
you must configure the other project to provide read/write access to 
the build service.

Provision deployment groups
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/deployment-groups/?view=azure-devops
A deployment group is a logical set of deployment target machines that have 
agents installed on each one.
------------------------------------------------------------------
These machines may be in Azure or any cloud provider or on-premise.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Deployment groups represent the physical environments. 
For example, "Dev", "Test", or "Production" environment. 
In effect, a deployment group is just another grouping of agents, 
much like an agent pool.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Deployment groups are 
- only available with Classic release pipelines 
- are different from deployment jobs

Deployment Job
A deployment job is a collection of deployment-related steps defined
in a YAML file to accomplish a specific task

With deployment groups you can:

-Specify the security context and runtime targets for the agents.
As you create a deployment group, you add users and give them appropriate
permissions to administer, manage, view, and use the group.

-Let you view live logs for each server as a deployment takes place, 
and download logs for all servers to track your deployments down to 
individual machines.

-Enable you to use machine tags to limit deployment to specific sets
of target servers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
In the end the purpose of Deployment Groups is to group a set of
VMs on which the Azure DevOps Agent is installed so that the DG
can be used as a TARGET of a RELEASE PIPELINE

Gates allow automatic collection of health signals from external 
services.
Promote the release when all the signals are successful 
at the same time 
or 
stop the deployment on timeout. 
Typically, gates are used in connection with 
- incident management
- problem management
- change management
- monitoring
- external approval systems.

pre-deployment conditions are set as conditions PRIOR TO the execution of 
a stage in a release pipeline.

with a pre-deployment approval 
- you can set a user as approver
- you can set a timer for the expiration of a pending deployment approval

AZ-400 Release Pipelines - Gate - Query Work Items
https://www.udemy.com/course/azure100/learn/lecture/33385716#overview

post-deployment conditions are set AFTER a stage of a release pipeline has 
executed.
Gates are part of the set of post-deployment conditions.
Gates are versateil as there are several kinds of chekcs that may be used 
to define a gate.
-----------------------------------------
- Check Azure Policy Compliance
- Invoke Azure Function
- Invoke a REST api
- Query Azure Monitor
- Query work Items
- SonarCloud Quality Gate status check
-----------------------------------------
Example: Query work Items
- you can create a save a named query to be performed on the development 
  board such as one that counts the number of tasks that are not in closed 
  state
- you can then instruct the gate to perform the query on a scheduled poll
  and set a numeric threshold. 
- If the result of the query is above the Upper Threshold the gate prevents
  the execution of the next stage in the release pipeline
- the query for the gate is evaluated continuosly
- it is possible to alos set a steady state target, etc.
- ** you must give the Identity of teh Build Service Read Permission on the
  shared query that the gate wants to run.

AZ-400 Release Pipelines - Gate - Azure Monitor Alerts
https://www.udemy.com/course/azure100/learn/lecture/33385742#overview

- go to Azure Monitor and create an **Alert Rule**
- for example if you are going to deploy a App Service or VMs you may 
  create a rule based on a 
  - Metric
  - Log
  - Activity Log
  - Resource Health
- for example you may measure the CPU Average Aggregate value over the 
  last 30 mins and set a threshold over which an alert is triggert
- For each Alert Rule you may set an **Action** or **Action Group**

- Go to the stage of the Release Pipeline on which you want to set 
  a gate > Select Subscription > Select Resource Group > Advanced
  > ** Filter Type: By Alert Rule **
  > select the name of the Alert Rule you have created
- Monitor Condition: fired => the Gate will prevent the execution of 
  next stage in the Release Pipeline 

In the is an noticeable increase of the CPU Average Aggregate metric 
(or any other significant Metric) of the piece of infrastructure on 
which new softare has been just deployed by means of a prior stage of
the Release Pipeline then the gate prevents that the next stage is 
executed i.e. it prevents, in an automated fashion, progressions such as

PT01-Q13: 

You are currently defining a release strategy for an app, named APP-01. 
The strategy should allow you to keep the time it takes to deploy new 
releases of the app to a minimum. The strategy should also allow you to 
roll back in the shortest time required. 

Which of the following is the release strategy you should use?

A13-1: Red/Black deployment
A13-2: Rolling deployment
A13-3: Big Bang deployment

suggested answer
Blue/Green = Red/Black. So answer is correct

REFS
What is the difference between blue/green and red/black deployments?
https://octopus.com/blog/blue-green-red-black

-------------------------
blue/green AND red/black:
-------------------------
with each color representing a copy of the target environment. 
Deploy a new versions of a centralized application like a web service, 
AND direct production traffic to the new version only after it has been 
successfully deployed and optionally tested.
** Traffic is routed to one color OR the other**
** 
Having two environments running side by side hosting different versions
of an application means traffic can be switched over, and back again if
an issue is found, with little to no downtime.
**

---------------------------------------------------------------------
So why is this strategy referred to as both green/blue and red/black?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
BLUE-GREEN

in blue-green deployment, both versions may be getting requests at the 
same time **temporarily**.

READ-BLACK
in red-black only one of the versions is getting traffic at any point 
in time

----------------------
Rolling Deployment
https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/rolling-deployment
----------------------
In a rolling upgrade, only part of the server capacity for an application
is offline at a given time. In a rolling deployment, the organization can
take one of the nodes in each tier offline, with the load balancer configured
to direct traffic to the remaining servers still running the current software
version. 

The idle servers receive updates and testing; the remaining online servers 
support user traffic.
The number of simultaneous deployment targets in a rolling deployment is 
referred to as the window size

------------------------------
ROLLING DEPLOYMENT CONSTRAINT
------------------------------
For a successful rolling deployment, IT teams ****must**** ensure backward 
compatibility across the stack
Some nodes might be running newer versions while others are still on older
versions during a rolling deployment. Older versions of web or application 
components must work with new database schema, or vice versa.

------------------------------
ROLLING DEPLOYMENT ADVANTAGES
------------------------------
Rolling deployments do not require as much underlying IT resource capacity
as blue/green deployments. 

--------------------

--------------------
A canary deployment is a progressive rollout of an application that splits 
traffic between an already-deployed version and a new version, rolling it 
out to a subset of users before rolling out fully.

A canary deployment gives you a chance to partially release your application.
In this way, you can ensure the new version of your application is reliable
before you deliver it to all users.

- Subnet traffic-routing method.

-----------------
Typical Use Cases
-----------------
------------------
Canary Deployment: 
------------------
Weighted traffic-routing method.
For example, assign weight 
100 to the current version of the app
and 
10 to the new version of the app.

Then gradualy increase the weight of the new version of the app.

-----------------------------------
Increase Resilience Accross Regions
-----------------------------------
Priority traffic-routing method. 

Assign a high priority ot the app deplyed to the region where 
its user are located and a low priaority to the deployed app 
on a fall-back region.

RESF
From the question posts and in particular the following
https://www.exam-answer.com/how-to-scan-only-production-dependencies-with-whitesource-bolt-in-a-node-js-application
it is possible to summarize the answers a s follow.

STEP-1: this maps to answer .C 
	
	STEP-1a
	Identify the libraries that are only used during development.

	Review the project's dependencies and determine which ones are 
	only used during development and not part of a production deployment. 
	This will help you to exclude these libraries from the WhiteSource 
	Bolt scan.

	STEP-1b
	Modify the devDependencies section of the project's Package.json file. 

	The devDependencies section in the package.json file contains the 
	libraries that are only required during development. You can add the
	invalid licensed libraries to this section to ensure that they are not
	included in the WhiteSource Bolt scan.

	When we add devDependencies and during installation add the 
	productionflag the devDependencies will not be installed.

STEP-2: this maps to answer .A 

	Run npm install and specify the --production flag. 

	The npm install command is used to install dependencies for a Node.js project. 
	By adding the --production flag to this command, you can ensure that only the
	production dependencies are installed, and the development dependencies are excluded.

-----------------------------------------------
Therefore the correct answer should be .A + .C
-----------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------
What about the remaining options .B & .D ?
-----------------------------------------------

While it is that .A + .C is indeed the correct answer,
it's also a good practice to 

.B: 
Modify the policy to exclude development dependencies 
Modify the WhiteSource Bolt policy and set the action for 
the licenses used by the development tools to Reassign.

and 
.D: 
Configure WhiteSource Bolt to scan only the production 
dependencies.

Suggested Answer: D
With Conditional Access, you can implement automated access control decisions for accessing your cloud
apps that are based on conditions.
Explanation
You can make use of Conditional access in Azure AD. 
You would first ensure the devices are joined to Azure AD. 
Then in Conditional access , you can set the policy to only allow access if the device is joined to Azure AD.

REFS

Conditional access policies
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/change-application-access-policies?view=azure-devops#conditional-access-policies

Azure AD allows tenants to define which users are allowed to gain access to Microsoft
resources through their Conditional Access Policy (CAP) feature. 
Through these settings, the tenant admin can require members must adhere to any of the
following conditions, for example, the user must:

-1 be a member of a specific security group
-2 belong to a certain location and/or network
-3 be using a specific operating system
-4 be using an enabled device in a management system

In this example a conditional access policy with a combination of 
condition-2 + condition-4 
may be used.

Suggestions
1-
When you need to compile an Internet Information Services (IIS) web application that runs on Docker, 
you should use a Hosted Windows Container build agent pool.
This is because IIS is a web server created by Microsoft specifically for Windows-based systems. 
Since you want to run the application in a Docker container, a Hosted Windows Container build agent pool
will provide the necessary Windows environment along with Docker support.
The Hosted Windows Container build agent pool is a pre-configured, managed pool provided by Azure DevOps
or other CI/CD platforms, which supports running Docker containers on a Windows-based system. 
By using this pool, you can ensure that your IIS web application is built and run in the appropriate 
environment.

In a Pipeline there are the following concepts.
---------------------
Stages > Jobs > Steps
---------------------
Therefore a Pipeline may be described as a 
Stages
sequence of Stages that are link to each other in seriesand/or in parallel.
Jobs
Each Stage is a sequence of Jobs where several jobs may be linked to each either in series.
Steps
Each Job is a sequence of Steps where several steps may be linked to each either in series.
Job Agent
Each Job in a pipeline runs its steps on a specified Agent
This Agent may be a Hosted-Agent (on Azure Infrastructure) or a Self-Hosted (on-premise/private Cloud)
Agent Pool
An Agent may also be part of an Agent Pool that is registered at the Azure DevOps Organization Level.
An Agent Pool a way to organize Registered Agents for teh Organization that makes use of them in their Pipelines.


REFS

Create and manage agent pools
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/pools-queues?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbrowser
An agent pool is a collection of agents. Instead of managing each agent individually, you organize agents into 
agent pools. When you configure an agent, it is registered with a single pool, and when you create a pipeline, 
you specify the pool in which the pipeline runs. When you run the pipeline, it runs on an agent from that pool
that meets the demands of the pipeline.
----------------------------------------------------------------
In Azure Pipelines, Agent Pools are scoped to the entire organization; 
so you can share the agent machines across projects.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Agent pool jobs run a job on a single agent.
If you need to run a job on all agents see Deployment Groups
----------------------------------------------------------------
Default Agent Pools
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/pools-queues?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbrowser#default-agent-pools

- Default pool: 
Use it to register self-hosted agents that you've set up.

- Azure Pipelines hosted pool : 
with various Windows, Linux, and macOS images. 
The Azure Pipelines hosted pool replaces the previous hosted pools

----------------------------------------------------------------
Create agent pools
Here are some typical situations when you might want to create self-hosted agent pools:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/pools-queues?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbrowser#create-agent-pools

-1
You're a member of a project and you want to use a set of machines owned by your team
for running build and deployment jobs.
You must have Administrator role to be able to create new pools. 

-2
You're a member of the infrastructure team and would like to set up a pool of agents
for use in all projects. 
Select the option to Auto-provision this agent pool in all projects while creating the pool. 

-3
You want to share a set of agent machines with multiple projects, but not all of them. 
First, navigate to the settings for one of the projects, add an agent pool, and select 
the option to create a new pool at the organization level. Next, go to each of the other 
projects, and create a pool in each of them while selecting the option to Use an existing
agent pool from the organization. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run a self-hosted agent in Docker
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/docker?view=azure-devops

You can set up a self-hosted agent in Azure Pipelines to run inside a Windows Server Core 
(for Windows hosts), or Ubuntu container (for Linux hosts) with Docker

User Case
This is useful when you want to run agents with outer orchestration, such as Azure Container Instances.
In this article, you'll walk through a complete container example, including handling agent self-update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure DevOps Container Jobs

Define container jobs (YAML)
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/container-phases?view=azure-devops
User Case for Container Jobs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Linux and Windows agents, **jobs** may be run on the host or in a container.
Containers provide isolation from the host and allow you to pin specific versions 
of tools and dependencies. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, jobs run on the **host machine** where the agent is installed. 
Over time, you may find that you want more control over the context where your 
tasks run.
YAML pipelines offer container jobs for this level of control.

About Container Jobs - AZ-400 Udemy Course
https://www.udemy.com/course/azure100/learn/lecture/33386920#overview
User Case for Container Jobs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An additional reason to run Jobs in a container is when you want to use a 
Self-Hosted agent perhaps on on-premise infrastructure and you also want to 
use as little infrastructure as possible to minimize costs. By using Docker
Containers to run Jobs you can pack on the same machine as many specific tools
as possible without versioning or other conflicts.

Another Scenario is when you want to build a Container Image with an application 
in it. This question referens to this scenario and specifically a WebApp that is
run in IIS.

Quickstart: Build a container image to deploy apps using Azure Pipelines
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/containers/build-image?view=azure-devops
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to build a container image for app deployment using Azure Pipelines. 
To build this image, all you need is a Dockerfile in your repository.
You can build Linux or Windows containers, based on the agent that you use 
in your pipeline.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To meet the requirement of this question we need
- A Windows based Host Agent because the App must use a Windows Container as IIS
is a required part of the container

Deploy existing .NET apps as Windows containers
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modernize-with-azure-containers/modernize-existing-apps-to-cloud-optimized/deploy-existing-net-apps-as-windows-containers

In Windows Containers, the process of packaging applications is fully automated. 
The main improvement you get from using the Docker engine is that you create images, 
which are like snapshots of your application, with all its dependencies.
The images run ASP.NET apps in containers, without going back to source code.
The container snapshot becomes the unit of deployment.

Existing .NET applications refer to those applications that were created using the 
.NET Framework. For example, they might be traditional ASP.NET web applications-they 
don't use .NET Core or .NET 5+, which is newer and runs cross-platform on Linux, Windows,
and MacOS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main dependency in the .NET Framework is Windows. 
It also has secondary dependencies, like IIS, and System.Web in traditional ASP.NET.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose an OS to target with .NET-based containers
Given the diversity of operating systems that are supported by Docker, as well as 
the differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core, you should target a specific 
OS and specific versions based on the framework you are using.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For Windows, you can use Windows Server Core or Windows Nano Server.
.Net Framework 3.5, 4.x => Windows Server Core
.Net => Windows Nano Server

In migration scenarios for existing or legacy applications that are based 
on .NET Framework applications, the main dependencies are on Windows and IIS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For Linux, multiple distros are available and supported in official .NET Docker images (like Debian).

About default processes and process templates
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process?view=azure-devops&tabs=agile-process&source=docs
A.BASIC: Choose Basic when your team wants the simplest model that uses Issues, Tasks, and Epics to track work.
B.AGILE: This process works great if you want to track user stories and (optionally) bugs on the Kanban board, or track bugs and tasks on the taskboard.
C.SCRUM: This process works great if you want to track product backlog items (PBIs) and bugs on the Kanban board, or break PBIs and bugs down into tasks on the taskboard.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The objective of CMMI ist to provide improved clarity on the work and process to the stakeholders 
and the development team.

- CMMI does not use User Stories as these are replaced by Requirements
- CMMI applies the concepts of Feedback and Code Review Feedback
- CMMI Epic: a business initiative to be accomplished
- CMMI Feature: a shippable component of software
- CMMI Requirement: a Work Item to track on the board! (kind of a replacement for the User Story)
- CMMI Bug: something that si missing or wrongly implemented
- CMMI Task: the SMALLEST UNIT OF WORK
- CMMI Change Request: the work is valid but it is required to implement something else
- CMMI Issue: any other custom type

- CMMI Review: to review some work
- CMMI Risk: a tyep of risk that may be associated with some particular work

A03-4: Licence procurement

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/assign-access-levels-by-group-membership?view=azure-devops
Add a group rule to assign access levels
You don't need to automate license management to reflect changes in your organizational structure on a per-user basis.
Important
Group rules only apply to users without direct assignments and to users added to the group going forward.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/billing/buy-basic-access-add-users?view=azure-devops
Azure DevOps Security - Manage paid access for users
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The easiest way to control paid access is to manually assign an access level. 

You can assign the access level when you add a new user to your organization. 
Also, remove users when they leave your organization.

Keep the following information in mind:

- Visual Studio subscribers get detected automatically when they sign in. 
  There's no extra charge for users with a Visual Studio subscription.
- Stakeholder is a free access level with limited functionality.
- Basic is free for the first 5 users, and paid for 6 or more users.
- Basic + Test Plans is paid only, but is free to try for 30 days.

-By default all new users get the free Stakeholder access if they're added directly to a project.
-
You as **Project Collection Admin** or as **Organization Owner** can change the 
access level for new users added to projects from the UI. 

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/billing/buy-basic-access-add-users?view=azure-devops#automate-access-with-group-rules
Automate access with group rules
This way, you don't have to manually assign access each time a user gets added or removed.
- A group rule supersedes the default access level.
- The default access level applies to users who aren't part of any group rules.
- Billing stops automatically when users get removed from your organization or are assigned the free Stakeholder access level.

PT01-Q02: 
The **Burnup widget** 
meausures the elapsed time from the creation of work items to their completion.

Which of the following is the widget you should use?

A02-1: No adjustment is required
A02-2: Lead Time
A02-3: Test Results Trend
A02-4: Burndown

MY ANSWER TO PT01-Q02
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this question the **Burnup widget** does not match the definition
**meausures the elapsed time from the creation of work items to their completion**
that is the definition of the LEAD TIME.
Therefore the **Burnup widget** token should be replaced with the token
A02-2: Lead Time.

suggested correct answer
A01-3: Cycle time = CT

CFD: View and configure a Cumulative Flow Diagram
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/report/dashboards/cumulative-flow?view=azure-devops
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You use cumulative flow diagrams (CFD) to monitor the flow of work through a system.
CFD charts display the count of work items grouped by state/Kanban column over time.
The two primary metrics to track 
**cycle time** 
**lead time**
, can be extracted from the chart.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two CFD charts: view from a team backlog or Kanban.
CFDs help teams monitor the count of work items as they progressively move through various workflow states.
These diagrams can show the flow of epics, features, user stories, issues, product backlog items, or requirements, 
depending on the process selected for your project:

Cumulative flow, lead time, and cycle time guidance
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/report/dashboards/cumulative-flow-cycle-lead-time-guidance?view=azure-devops
-------------------------------------------
The CFD answers several specific questions

1-Will the team complete work on time?

2-How is the flow of work progressing?=Is the team completing work at a steady pace?
Falt Lines and Bulges in CFD
----------------------------
Falt Lines=> CADENCE
Flat lines appear when the team doesn't update their work with a regular cadence.
Flat lines can also appear when the work across one or more processes takes longer than planned. 
Flat lines appear across many parts of the system because if only one part of the system or two 
parts of a system have problems then you'll see a bulge.
----------------------------
3-How do you fix flow problems?
----------------------------
Daily stand-ups.
Other regular meetings.
Scheduling a daily team reminder email.
----------------------------
Bulges => VELOCITY BOTTLENECKS
Bulges occur when work builds up in one part of the system and isn't moving through a process.
Bulges can occur when testing takes a long period of time while development takes a shorter 
period of time.
Bulges indicate that a succeeding step is having a problem, not necessarily the step in which 
the bulge is occurring
----------------------------
4-How do you fix Bulges problems?
----------------------------
Example
Two potentially easy ways to solve this problem are: 
1) 
Shift developers from the development process to the testing process until the bulge is 
eliminated 
or 
2) 
change the order of work such that work that can be done quickly is interwoven with 
work that takes longer to do.

Lead Time VS Cycle Time and How Kanban/Lean Can Help Continuous Delivery and DevOps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRqUhj3mj70 

**lead time**
For a continuous flow process: 
Measures the amount of time it takes from when a request is made
(such as adding a proposed user story) until that request is completed (closed).
That is this is the time mesured from thwe CREATION of a WI to its COMPLETION.

**cycle time**
Measures the time it takes to move work through a single process or workflow state. 
Calculation is from the start of one process to the start of the next process.
That is this is the time mesured from when the state of a WI becomes ACTIVE/COMMITTED 
to its COMPLETION.
For a sprint or fixed period process: Measures the time from when work on a request begins until
the work is completed (i.e. the time from Active to Closed).

It is always that LD > CT
The LD includes the time required for ANALYSIS, APPROVAL, etc.
The CT measures the time that is required to BUILD the WI by the dev team.

Measuring DevOps
-------------------------------
AGILITY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
-------------------------------
-Frequency of deployment
-Speed of deployment
-Change in LT
-Speed of build verification
-------------------------------
RELIABILITY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
-------------------------------
-Change of Fail Rate
-Incident/Defect Volume
-MMTD=Mean Time To Detect
-MMTR=Mean Time To Repair
-------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------
Plan using estimate delivery times based on lead/cycle times
--------------------------------------------------------------
You can use the average lead/cycle times and standard deviations to estimate 
delivery times. Likewise, you can use cycle time and its standard deviation to estimate 
the completion of a work item once work has begun.
