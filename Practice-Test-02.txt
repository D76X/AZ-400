The Playwright library provides cross-browser automation through a single API.
with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation
that is evergreen, capable, reliable, and fast. Because Microsoft Edge is built
 on the open-source Chromium web platform, Playwright is also able to automate
 Microsoft Edge.

Playwright launches headless browsers by default. 
Headless browsers don't display a UI, so instead you must use the command line.
You can also configure Playwright to run full (non-headless) Microsoft Edge 
as well.

Suggested Answer: C. Azure Data Explorer

There are several tools available for running queries in Azure Data Explorer,
including Kusto.
Kusto uses a role-based access control (RBAC) model, under which authenticated
principals are mapped to roles, and get access according to the roles they're
assigned.
Note: Azure Data Explorer is a highly scalable and secure analytics service
that enables you to do rich exploration of structured and unstructured data
for instant insights. 
Optimized for ad-hoc queries, Azure Data Explorer enables rich data exploration
over raw, structured, and semi-structured data delivering fast time to insight.
Query with a modern, intuitive query language that offers fast, ad-hoc, and 
advanced query capabilities over high-rate data volumes and varieties

Suggested Answer: A. the Smart Detection feature in Azure Application Insights

Smart detection in Application Insights
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/proactive-diagnostics

2)
Smart detection **automatically warns** you of potential 
performance problems and failure anomalies in your web application. 
It performs proactive analysis of the telemetry that your app sends to 
Application Insights. If there's a sudden rise in failure rates or abnormal patterns
in client or server performance, you get an alert. 
-------------------------------------
This feature needs no configuration. 
-------------------------------------
It operates if your application sends enough telemetry.

-------------------------------------
Smart detection email notifications
-------------------------------------

All smart detection rules, except for rules marked as preview, are configured 
by default to send email notifications when detections are found.
You can configure email notifications for a specific smart detection rule. 
On the smart detection Settings pane, select the rule to open the Edit rule pane.

Alternatively, you can change the configuration by using 
Azure Resource Manager templates. 
For more information, see Manage Application Insights smart detection rules
by using Azure Resource Manager templates.
