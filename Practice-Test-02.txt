QUESTION POSTS
https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/35920-exam-az-400-topic-4-question-3-discussion/

Suggested Answer: A. personal access token (PAT)
Note: 
PAT Supported only on Azure Pipelines and TFS 2017 and newer. 
After you choose PAT, paste the PAT token you created into the command 
prompt window. Use a personal access token (PAT) if your Azure DevOps 
Server or TFS instance and the agent machine are not in a trusted domain. 
PAT authentication is handled by your Azure DevOps Server or TFS instance 
instead of the domain controller.

Reference:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-linux

The user configuring the agent needs 
POOL ADMIN PERMISSION 
but the user running the agent does not.

---------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT!

The folders controlled by the agent should be restricted to as few users
as possible and they contain secrets that could be decrypted or exfiltrated.
The Azure Pipelines agent is a software product designed to execute code 
it downloads from external sources. It inherently could be a target for 
Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks.

Therefore, it is important to consider the threat model surrounding each 
individual usage of Pipelines Agents to perform work, and decide what are
 the minimum permissions could be granted to 
 
- the user running the agent 
- to the machine where the agent runs 
- to the users who have write access to the Pipeline definition
- to the git repos where the yaml is stored
- or to the group of users who control access to the pool for new pipelines.

IMPORTANT

It is a best practice to have the identity running the agent be different 
from the identity with permissions to connect the agent to the pool.
The user generating the credentials (and other agent-related files) is 
different than the user that needs to read them.
Therefore, it is safer to carefully consider access granted to the agent 
machine itself, and the agent folders which contain sensitive files, 
such as logs and artifacts.

Suggested Answer: C. a readiness probe

** readiness probes **
For containerized applications that serve traffic, you might want to verify that
your container is ready to handle incoming requests. 
Azure Container Instances supports readiness probes to include configurations so
that your container can't be accessed under certain conditions.

Incorrect Answers:
** liveness probes **
A: Containerized applications may run for extended periods of time, resulting in
broken states that may need to be repaired by restarting the container. 
Azure Container Instances supports liveness probes so that you can configure your
containers within your container group to restart if critical functionality is not working.

Suggested Answer: C. a gate

Scenarios and use cases for gates include: Quality validation.

Query metrics from tests on the build artifacts such as pass rate or code 
coverage and deploy only if they are within required thresholds.
Use Quality Gates to integrate monitoring into your pre-deployment or post-deployment.
This ensures that you are meeting the key health/performance metrics (KPIs) as 
your applications move from dev to production and any differences in the 
infrastructure environment or scale is not negatively impacting your KPIs.

Note: 
Gates allow automatic collection of health signals from external services,
and then promote the release when all the signals are successful at the same
time or stop the deployment on timeout. 
Typically, gates are used in connection with 
incident management, problem management, change management, monitoring, and
external approval systems.

----------------------------------
Azure Load Balancer health probes
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-custom-probe-overview
----------------------------------

Azure Load Balancer rules require a health probe to detect the endpoint status. 
Use health probes 
 - to detect the failure of an application. 
 - to generate a custom response to a health probe.
 - for flow control to manage load or planned downtime.

When a health probe fails, the load balancer stops sending new connections to
the respective unhealthy instance.

Probe protocols > Basic SKU: TCP, HTTP > Std SKU: +HTTPS

--------------------
Probe down behavior
--------------------

Scenario 1- Single instance probes down
New TCP connections succeed to remaining healthy backend endpoint.
Established TCP connections to this backend endpoint continue.

Scenario 2- All instances probe down
No new flows are sent to the backend pool. 

 > Standard Load Balancer 
   allows established TCP flows to continue given that a backend pool
   has more than one backend instance. 
 > Basic Load Balancer terminates all existing TCP flows to the backend pool.

-1 HTTPS probes don't support mutual authentication with a client certificate.
-2 A Basic SKU load balancer health probe isn't supported with a virtual machine scale set.
-3 You should assume health probes fail when TCP timestamps are enabled.
-4 HTTP probes don't support probing on the following ports due to 
   security concerns: 19, 21, 25, 70, 110, 119, 143, 220, 993.

Monitoring your application health for managing and upgrading your deployment. 
Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets provide support for 
 - Rolling Upgrades 
 - including Automatic OS-Image Upgrades 
- Automatic VM Guest Patching,
  which rely on health monitoring of the individual instances to upgrade
  your deployment. 
  
You can also use Application Health Extension to monitor the application health
of each instance in your scale set and 
- perform instance repairs using Automatic Instance Repairs.

two types of Application Health extension
 - Binary Health States 
 - Rich Health States

---------------------------------------------
When to use the Application Health extension
---------------------------------------------
The extension probes on a local application endpoint and will update the health
status based on TCP/HTTP(S) responses received from the application.
This health status is used by Azure to initiate repairs on unhealthy instances
and to determine if an instance is eligible for upgrade operations. 

The extension reports health 
********************************************************************* 
from within a VM and can be used in situations where an external 
probe such as the Azure Load Balancer health probes can’t be used.
*********************************************************************

Note:

This last statement confirms that Application Health extension can be used 
with teh VMs of the scale set VMSS1 in this scanario in place of the  
Azure Load Balancer health probe which cannot be used in this case due to
the requirement of the HTTPS mutual authentication by using a client 
certificate which is not a supported scenario of the Azure Load Balancer 
health probe.

Suggested Answer: BD
B. From the code of the application, enable adaptive sampling.
D. Add the <MaxTelemetryItemsPerSecond>5</MaxTelemetryItemsPerSecond> parameter to the ApplicationInsights.config file.

Most Voted Answer: CD 
C. From the code of the application, add Azure Application Insights telemetry.
E. From the code of the application, disable adaptive sampling. 

Comment:
E is "disable adaptive sampling". it does no make sense. 
the question mentioned "minimize cost of storing the telemetry data", so adaptive 
sampling should not be disabled. And, in ASP.NET Core, 
adaptive sampling is enabled by default.

Sampling in Application Insights
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/sampling

It's the recommended way 
 - to reduce telemetry traffic
 - to reduce data costs and storage costs
   while preserving a statistically correct analysis of application data. 
 - avoid Application Insights throttling your telemetry

The sampling filter selects items that are related, so that you can 
navigate between items when you're doing diagnostic investigations.
When metric counts are presented in the portal, they're renormalized to
take into account sampling. Doing so minimizes any effect on the statistics.

There are three different types of sampling: 
 - adaptive sampling : enabled by default in all recent SDKs
 - fixed-rate sampling 
 - ingestion sampling : It doesn't reduce telemetry traffic sent from your app, 
   but helps you keep within your monthly quota.
   The main advantage of ingestion sampling is that you can set the sampling
   rate without redeploying your app. 


When to use sampling?
In general, for most small and medium size applications you don't need sampling.

 - Application Insights service drops ("throttles") data points when 
   your app sends a high rate of telemetry in a short time interval. 
   Sampling reduces the likelihood that your application sees throttling occur.
 - To keep within the quota of data points for your pricing tier.
 - To reduce network traffic from the collection of telemetry.

-----------------
Adaptive sampling
-----------------
Adaptive sampling is enabled by default when you use the 
ASP.NET SDK or the 
ASP.NET Core SDK, 
and is also enabled by default for Azure Functions.

The volume is adjusted automatically to keep within a specified maximum 
rate of traffic, and is controlled via the setting 
-----------------------------
MaxTelemetryItemsPerSecond. 
-----------------------------

----------------------
Fixed-rate sampling
----------------------
Fixed-rate sampling reduces the traffic sent from your web server and web browsers. 
Unlike adaptive sampling, it reduces telemetry at a fixed rate decided by you. 
Fixed-rate sampling is available for ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java and Python applications.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring fixed-rate sampling for ASP.NET Core applications
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Disable adaptive sampling

Changes can be made after the WebApplication.CreateBuilder() method, 
using ApplicationInsightsServiceOptions:

```
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var aiOptions = new Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore.Extensions.ApplicationInsightsServiceOptions();
aiOptions.EnableAdaptiveSampling = false; // Disable !
builder.Services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(aiOptions);
var app = builder.Build();
```

2. Enable the fixed-rate sampling module

Changes can be made after the WebApplication.CreateBuilder() method:

```
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.Configure<TelemetryConfiguration>(telemetryConfiguration =>
{
    var builder = telemetryConfiguration.DefaultTelemetrySink.TelemetryProcessorChainBuilder;

    // Using fixed rate sampling
    double fixedSamplingPercentage = 10;
    builder.UseSampling(fixedSamplingPercentage);
});

builder.Services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(new ApplicationInsightsServiceOptions
{
    EnableAdaptiveSampling = false,
});

var app = builder.Build(); 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring fixed-rate sampling for ASP.NET applications
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Disable adaptive sampling: In ApplicationInsights.config, remove
   or comment out the AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor node.

<TelemetryProcessors>
    <!-- Disabled adaptive sampling:
    <Add Type="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel.AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor, Microsoft.AI.ServerTelemetryChannel">
        <MaxTelemetryItemsPerSecond>5</MaxTelemetryItemsPerSecond>
    </Add>
    -->

2. Enable the fixed-rate sampling module. Add this snippet to ApplicationInsights.config:
<TelemetryProcessors>
    <Add Type="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel.SamplingTelemetryProcessor, Microsoft.AI.ServerTelemetryChannel">
        <!-- Set a percentage close to 100/N where N is an integer. -->
        <!-- E.g. 50 (=100/2), 33.33 (=100/3), 25 (=100/4), 20, 1 (=100/100), 0.1 (=100/1000) -->
        <SamplingPercentage>10</SamplingPercentage>
    </Add>
</TelemetryProcessors>

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/proactive-diagnostics

2)
Smart detection **automatically warns** you of potential 
performance problems and failure anomalies in your web application. 
It performs proactive analysis of the telemetry that your app sends to 
Application Insights. If there's a sudden rise in failure rates or abnormal patterns
in client or server performance, you get an alert. 
-------------------------------------
This feature needs no configuration. 
-------------------------------------
It operates if your application sends enough telemetry.

-------------------------------------
Smart detection email notifications
-------------------------------------

All smart detection rules, except for rules marked as preview, are configured 
by default to send email notifications when detections are found.
You can configure email notifications for a specific smart detection rule. 
On the smart detection Settings pane, select the rule to open the Edit rule pane.

Alternatively, you can change the configuration by using 
Azure Resource Manager templates.
