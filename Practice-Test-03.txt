Suggested Answer: A. Yes

Note: 
Technical debt is the accumulation of sub-optimal technical decisions made
over the lifetime of an application. Eventually, it gets harder to change 
things: it's the 'sand in the gears' that sees IT initiatives grind to a halt.


Reference:

5 Ways DevOps Helps With Technical Debt
https://www.devopsgroup.com/blog/five-ways-devops-helps-with-technical-debt/

It is worth pointing out that technical debt doesn’t only occur in development, 
** it can occur in operations too **.
For Example:

- Still running an out-of-date OS that’s no longer supported, like Windows Server 2008 or Ubuntu 11.04
- Not keeping your servers patched and up to date 
- leaving you vulnerable to cyber-attack and ransomware

--------------------------------
Is Technical Debt Always Bad?
--------------------------------

Refer ro the concept: TechnicalDebtQuadrant - Martin Fowler
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html

------------------------------------
Prudent, deliberate technical debt 
------------------------------------
is at the heart of Eric Ries’ ‘Build-Measure-Learn’ cycle from The Lean Startup.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkaabHiZN-k

------------------------------------------------------------
So, how can DevOps address the technical debt challenge?
------------------------------------------------------------

One of the key tenets of DevOps is creating small, multidisciplinary teams (i.e. Dev + Ops) 
who own the entire lifecycle of a product or service from ‘inception to retirement’. 
Because these teams (including their product managers) feel the impact of technical debt
every day, they are highly motivated to pay it back to make life easier.

****************************************************** 
Simple things can help teams tackle technical debt.
****************************************************** 

--------------------------------------------------
1. Create DevOps Product Teams 
--------------------------------------------------
You can do this by 

- labelling work items
-carve out part of every sprint to work on technical debt items 
( We’d suggest at least 20% of a sprint commitment)
- every team retro, do a quick thumbs up/down (or planning poker) on current levels of technical debt.
- try to avoid creating more technical debt in new product development.
- If you need to create prudent, deliberate technical debt, track it and allocate effort to pay it back in the future.

DevOps patterns and practices, like using CI/CD code pipelines to build, test, package
and deploy applications, enables teams to move faster, with less risk and less technical 
debt.
Code pipelines also provide end-to-end traceability of application code
– from user story to code commit to released package.

This helps derive clear, customer-driven priorities for where to focus technical 
debt repayment efforts.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Build Shared Self-Service Platforms 
--------------------------------------------------

** 
Increasingly, organisations are building shared self-service platforms to support product teams.
In other words, where possible use PaaS+Best Practices
**

More in detail..

- platforms help avoid the technical debt of having to build and maintain toolchains.
- Teams can consume a self-service platform (i.e. an internal or third party software-as-a-service (SaaS) style solution) instead.
- Platform teams build these services to meet the needs of product teams, along with best-practice templates, reference architectures and other code building blocks that might be needed.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Use DevOps Automation to Repay Tech Debt
--------------------------------------------------
But how does DevOps automation help repay technical debt?

-------------------------------------
‘virtuous circle’ of automation
-------------------------------------

The time you spend NOT troubleshooting deployments due to snowflake environment issues 
is time you can invest paying back even more technical debt. 
This leads to a ‘virtuous circle’ of automation.

CALMS Culture-Automation-Lean-Measurement-Sharing

Inherent in any DevOps approach is the heavy use of automation. 
he services platforms provide are often automation toolchains for the product teams to use.

------------------------------------------------------
The Problem of Inconsistency: minimize it  
------------------------------------------------------
- infrastructure-as-code 
- configuration-as-code 
can help repay technical debt while avoiding future debt.


Inconsistent aka ‘snowflake’ environments are a prevalent form of technical debt
that almost everyone will have experienced. When your application works in Dev but
not in Pre-Production or, even worse, not in Production, the root cause is often 
inconsistency. 

- operating system configuration
- application dependencies
- the myriad configuration settings upon which the application depends 
- the communication between different services that comprise the application

 The time you spend troubleshooting issues like these is the cost, the impact, of your technical debt.

- infrastructure-as-code 
- configuration-as-code 
enable you to precisely express your intent for how you want the environment to be.
Then, via the power of tools like Terraform and Puppet, you can (declaratively) ‘make it so’, 
** consistently ** in every instance of that environment. 

************************************
** Containerisation ** 
takes this to the next level.
************************************

-------------------------
As-code automation
-------------------------
‘As-code’ automation also has another benefit. 
Holding DevOps automation as code, in a repository like GitHub, rather than describing 
config settings in verbose Word documents or Visio diagrams, makes it simpler and easier
to iterate and improve. People can discover the code easily via search, submit suggested
changes via pull requests, or even fork code, modifying and extending it to meet their 
needs. 
This ability to iterate means automation code is less likely to get ‘out of date’ thereby
avoiding another form of technical debt.

-----------------------------------------------------------
4. Use Containers to Simplify App Deployment and Management
-----------------------------------------------------------
************************************
** Containerisation ** 
takes this to the next level.
************************************

containers enable you to hold 
 
 - your application 
 - its configuration 
 - OS dependencies 
 
in one lightweight bundle that’s easier to deploy and faster to provision.
As with the environment management automation example discussed earlier, 
the portability of containers simplifies everything.

Container orchestration tools like Kubernetes go even further, enabling 
automation of the container lifecycle in production, freeing DevOps teams
to focus on higher-value tasks (like re-architecting applications to reduce
technical debt).

Organisations building new, cloud-native applications typically use containers 
to improve 
 - flexibility
 - scalability 
 - total cost of ownership (TCO)

--------------------------------------------
The ‘microservices’ architectural pattern 
--------------------------------------------
 - works well with containers 
 and
 - more importantly, the small multidisciplinary DevOps product teams

Each microservice is 

 - small 
 - with a clear bounded context
 - managed by a long-lived team. 

** So, technical debt is easier to spot and fix **

-----------------------------------------------
5. Using DevOps to Build an API-Centric Model
** 
with APIs AND  ideally supporting ‘semantic versioning’ 
we can
1. REDUCE CODE COMPEXITY
2. REDUCE COUPLING BETWEEN PRODUCTS / FEATURS / PRODUCERS / CONSUMERS
-----------------------------------------------

The microservices model discussed above is one way to implement an 
API-centric application strategy.
Jeff Bezos famously challenged his teams to ONLY use APIs to communicate
between their systems “or be fired”.
Encouraging teams to build and consume APIs with well-defined, versioned 
interfaces is a great way to reduce technical debt.
Often, technical debt is caused by different systems accessing services 
and data in ways that other teams don’t expect. 

***************************************************************
APIs make these interfaces more visible and less fragile. 
less fragility = less technical debt
***************************************************************

https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/microsoft/view/78922-exam-az-400-topic-4-question-56-discussion/

Suggested Answer: A. Store the secrets in the environment variables instead of the pipeline variables.

Don't set secret variables in your YAML file. 
Operating systems often log commands for the processes that they run, and you
wouldn't want the log to include a secret that you passed in as an input. 

Use the **script's environment** 
or 
**
map the variable within the variables block to pass secrets to your pipeline.
**

The following example shows how to use a secret variable called mySecret in PowerShell 
and Bash scripts. Unlike a normal pipeline variable, there's no environment variable
called MYSECRET.

```
variables:
 GLOBAL_MYSECRET: $(mySecret) # this will not work because the secret variable needs to be mapped as env
 GLOBAL_MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(nonSecretVariable) # this works because it's not a secret.

steps:

- powershell: |
    Write-Host "Using an input-macro works: $(mySecret)"
    Write-Host "Using the env var directly does not work: $env:MYSECRET"
    Write-Host "Using a global secret var mapped in the pipeline does not work either: $env:GLOBAL_MYSECRET"
    Write-Host "Using a global non-secret var mapped in the pipeline works: $env:GLOBAL_MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR" 
    Write-Host "Using the mapped env var for this task works and is recommended: $env:MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR"
  env:
    MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(mySecret) # the recommended way to map to an env variable

- bash: |
    echo "Using an input-macro works: $(mySecret)"
    echo "Using the env var directly does not work: $MYSECRET"
    echo "Using a global secret var mapped in the pipeline does not work either: $GLOBAL_MYSECRET"
    echo "Using a global non-secret var mapped in the pipeline works: $GLOBAL_MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR" 
    echo "Using the mapped env var for this task works and is recommended: $MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR"
  env:
    MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(mySecret) # the recommended way to map to an env variable

```
-----------------------
Incorrect Answers:
-----------------------
B: Never pass secrets on the command line.

C: Adding a prefix does not make the variable a secret. 
The ** issecret property ** makes it secret but does not prevent logging of the secret.

D: Never echo secrets as output.

This Demo shows how to connect Slack to an Azure DevOps Build Pipelines
starting from within the Slack App. This implies that from the Slack
client you must install a custom app > Azure Pipelines.

Once installed in Slack you need

-1 to select a channel where the app is going to post.

-2 
in the selected slack channel you need to have the app to subscribe to the Azure
Buuild Pipelines of the Azure DevOp Organization that you wish to monitor on this 
channel.
This can be done by following the instructions given by Slack on the channel.

Example:

/azpipelines help

/azpipelines subscriptions >> 
this will get the app on this channel authenticated via ** OAuth ** to the Azure DevOps Organization

/azpipelines subscribe [pipelineURL/project URL]
the values for [pipelineURL/project URL] are on the Azure DevOps Portal for your Organization/Pipeline.

Suggested Answer: C. Black Duck

Secure and Manage Open Source Software
Black Duck helps organizations identify and mitigate open source security, 
license compliance and code-quality risks across application and container 
portfolios.
Black Duck Hub and its plugin for Team Foundation Server (TFS) allows you 
to automatically find and fix open source security vulnerabilities during 
the build process, so you can proactively manage risk. The integration allows
you to receive alerts and fail builds when any Black Duck Hub policy violations
are met.

Note: ** WhiteSource ** would also be a good answer, but it is not an option here.
